##Item 43: Consider contextlib and with Statements for Reusable try/finally Behavior

The with statement in Python is used to indicate when code is running in a special
context. For example, mutual exclusion locks (see Item 38: “Use Lock to Prevent Data
Races in Threads”) can be used in with statements to indicate that the indented code only
runs while the lock is held.

    lock = Lock()
    with lock:
    	print(‘Lock is held’)

The example above is equivalent to this **try**/**finally** construction because the **Lock**
class properly enables the **with** statement.

    lock.acquire()
    try:
    	print(‘Lock is held’)
    finally:
    	lock.release()

The **with** statement version of this is better because it eliminates the need to write the
repetitive code of the **try**/**finally** construction. It’s easy to make your objects and
functions capable of use in **with** statements by using the **contextlib** built-in module.
This module contains the **contextmanager** decorator, which lets a simple function be
used in **with** statements. This is much easier than defining a new class with the special
methods `__enter__` and `__exit__` (the standard way).

For example, say you want a region of your code to have more debug logging sometimes.
Here, I define a function that does logging at two severity levels:

    def my_function():
    	logging.debug(‘Some debug data’)
    	logging.error(‘Error log here’)
    	logging.debug(‘More debug data’)

The default log level for my program is **WARNING**, so only the error message will print to
screen when I run the function.

    my_function()
    >>>
    Error log here

I can elevate the log level of this function temporarily by defining a context manager. This
helper function boosts the logging severity level before running the code in the **with**
block and reduces the logging severity level afterward.

    @contextmanager
    def debug_logging(level):
	    logger = logging.getLogger()
	    old_level = logger.getEffectiveLevel()
	    logger.setLevel(level)
	    try:
	    	yield
	    finally:
	    	logger.setLevel(old_level)

The **yield** expression is the point at which the **with** block’s contents will execute. Any
exceptions that happen in the **with** block will be re-raised by the **yield** expression for
you to catch in the helper function (see Item 40: “Consider Coroutines to Run Many
Functions Concurrently” for an explanation of how that works).

Now, I can call the same logging function again, but in the **debug_logging** context.
This time, all of the debug messages are printed to the screen during the **with** block. The
same function running outside the **with** block won’t print debug messages.

	with debug_logging(logging.DEBUG):
		print(‘Inside:’)
		my_function()
	print(‘After:’)
	my_function()

	>>>
	Inside:
	Some debug data
	Error log here
	More debug data
	After:
	Error log here

##Using with Targets

The context manager passed to a **with** statement may also return an object. This object is
assigned to a local variable in the **as** part of the compound statement. This gives the code
running in the **with** block the ability to directly interact with its context.

For example, say you want to write a file and ensure that it’s always closed correctly. You
can do this by passing **open** to the **with** statement. **open** returns a file handle for the **as**
target of **with** and will close the handle when the **with** block exits.

	with open(‘/tmp/my_output.txt’, ‘w’) as handle:
		handle.write(‘This is some data!’)

This approach is preferable to manually opening and closing the file handle every time. It
gives you confidence that the file is eventually closed when execution leaves the **with**
statement. It also encourages you to reduce the amount of code that executes while the file
handle is open, which is good practice in general.

To enable your own functions to supply values for **as** targets, all you need to do is **yield**
a value from your context manager. For example, here I define a context manager to fetch
a **Logger** instance, set its level, and then **yield** it for the **as** target.

	@contextmanager
	def log_level(level, name):
		logger = logging.getLogger(name)
		old_level = logger.getEffectiveLevel()
		logger.setLevel(level)
		try:
			yield logger
		finally:
			logger.setLevel(old_level)

Calling logging methods like **debug** on the **as** target will produce output because the
logging severity level is set low enough in the **with** block. Using the **logging** module
directly won’t print anything because the default logging severity level for the default
program logger is **WARNING**.

	with log_level(logging.DEBUG, ‘my-log’) as logger:
		logger.debug(‘This is my message!’)
		logging.debug(‘This will not print’)

	>>>
	This is my message!

After the **with** statement exits, calling debug logging methods on the **Logger** named
'my-log' will not print anything because the default logging severity level has been
restored. Error log messages will always print.

	logger = logging.getLogger(‘my-log’)
	logger.debug(‘Debug will not print’)
	logger.error(‘Error will print’)

	>>>
	Error will print

##Things to Remember

* The with statement allows you to reuse logic from try/finally blocks and
reduce visual noise.
* The contextlib built-in module provides a contextmanager decorator that
makes it easy to use your own functions in with statements.
* The value yielded by context managers is supplied to the as part of the with
statement. It’s useful for letting your code directly access the cause of the special
context.
